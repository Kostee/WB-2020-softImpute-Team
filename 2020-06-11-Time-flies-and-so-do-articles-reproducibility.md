### Sometimes we forget about what is really important...

Have you ever stopped for a moment in the course of everyday life and looked better at the reproductivity of the scientific article being analyzed? If you are not in any technical industry - probably not... and it's fine. Otherwise - it's about time to start getting interested.

### Reproducibility, like wine? Or vice versa?

When publishing a work, you definitely need to remember about correct documentation, ensuring that files are up-to-date, and a few other classic rules. However, not everyone respects these laws, and hence - some articles <sooner of faster> lose their value, or at least readability. Time flies and it would seem like a peasant reason that the older the text, the harder to reproduce in today's conditions. Will this intuition be true? The topic has been studied in recent months by three young scientists from Warsaw University of Technology: Paweł Morgen, Piotr Sieńko and Konrad Welkier. The final conclusions - which are really worth looking at closely! - young men placed in a scientific article entitled "Aging articles. How time affects reproducibility of scientific papers". Curious about the results? I guarantee you'll be shocked!

### Hmm, if only there was a measure to compare datasets...

The young big heads set correlations as their distinctive element - as one of them wisely said: "The intention of such research is to find correlations between age of article and its reproducibility". It makes sense? I think we will agree that of course yes! The classic correlation measurement for finding similarity is always cool. They also agreed on a definition, which in some environments is already somewhat controversial, and here not everyone would agree with it without a fight - the reproductibility was considered to be able to read the methods presented in the old text in current time. However, they took it over from the best - because such a definition was already suggested 16 years ago by famous researchers Robert Gentleman and Duncan Temple Lang.

### I give you a grade of 3 - you are the best!

The boys did not do everything themselves - what poverty would have passed if the CodeExtractorR package for analyzing a large number of scientific articles had not come to their aid! They also put simplicity in the assessment of individual texts - they gave marks in order: 0 for absolete non-reproductiveness, 1 for ones without frenzy, 2 for generally satisfactory and 3 for just perfect. The three wise men also deserve respect when trying to be objective in giving these marks - but does objectivity actually exist?

### POWERFUL number of texts analyzed

280 articles from R Journal. This is probably a large number. Is that enough for the law of large numbers? Hahaha, we all remember these fun probability classes. But back to what is important! The results also apply only to articles from 2010-2019, but no matter how you looked - who had previously made up with R?

### Oh my God, really? Where are chases and explosions?

Codes have been reproduced, points were assigned and... zonk! To our annoyance the final result turned out to be quite... bland. Huge differences between 2019 and 2010? Not this time? Imagine that the final visualization resulted in not very big differences between today's times and the prehistory of early 2010s. Maybe it is true that full reproduction in the latest works was present much more often than in the good old days, but the trend is rather only for the era after Stephen Hawkings. Want play an in-depth analysis of bars with a trend unlike anything? Check out the brilliant article of our three men!

### Now we've all become smarter

I think that after this short lesson, we can all come up with two wise reflections: the world has not changed so much in the past 10 years, and after the death of Stephen Hawkings, scholars around the world unanimously began to attract much more attention to reproduction. As long as the correlation implies causation...
